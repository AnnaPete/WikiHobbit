# WikiHobbit
Mod 2 Static Comp Challenge 1

## Abstract
For my Turing class static comp project, I was tasked with recreating a picture of a website. I was given free reign over the content, but I had to gather my own assets and format my website as close to the original picture as possible.

Since I am a Tolkien fan, naturally I gravitated toward making my content related to the Lord of The Rings franchise. As a result, I created a static website that shows character cards, each containing basic information about a particular character in the franchise.
